                        <p>Once upon a time, there was a boy and a girl who attended the same school. In class 9, they had a crush on each other, but they never had the courage to confess their feelings. They both moved on to different classes, losing touch as they went on with their lives.

                            In class 11, the girl stumbled upon the boy's Instagram profile and sent him a message. They started texting and catching up on lost time. They talked about their interests, their goals, and their favorite things.
                            
                            As they talked more, their feelings for each other started to resurface. They both realized that they still had a crush on each other, even after all these years. They were both too shy to confess their feelings, but they both knew that they wanted to be together.
                            
                            Finally, in class 12, the girl mustered up the courage to ask the boy a question that had been weighing on her mind for a while. One night, she sent him a message on Instagram, "Will you marry me?"
                            
                            The boy was surprised by the question, but he was over </p>
